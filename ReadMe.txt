This repository is intended to store the code needed for the CS 499 project at the University of Kentucky. 

Project:
Create a way for a user to make their own environment and 
entities that exist within that environment. This program 
allows for a user to have a more visual and data driven example 
of things like natural selection, carrying capacity, 
genetic inheritance, etc. This will be done by giving the 
user a set of Nodes that they can socket into both the entities 
and the environment in order to change the behaviors.
